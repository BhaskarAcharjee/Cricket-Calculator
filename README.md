# Cricket Calculator

Cricket Calculator is a web application that allows you to calculate various metrics related to cricket matches. It includes two calculators: 
<br> **Net Run Rate (NRR) Calculator and Duckworth Lewis Target Calculator**.

## Net Run Rate (NRR) Calculator

The NRR Calculator helps you calculate the Net Run Rate for a cricket team. NRR is a statistical measure used in cricket to determine the average number of runs that a team scores per over compared to the average number of runs scored against them per over. It is commonly used in multi-team tournaments to rank teams with the same number of points.

To use the NRR Calculator:

1. Visit the [Cricket Calculator](https://bhaskaracharjee.github.io/NRR-Calculator/) web application.
2. Enter the total runs scored by the team.
3. Enter the total overs faced by the team.
4. Enter the total runs conceded by the team.
5. Enter the total overs bowled by the team.

The NRR Calculator will provide the calculated NRR value based on the inputs provided.

## Duckworth Lewis Target Calculator

The Duckworth Lewis Target Calculator helps you calculate the target score for the team batting second in limited-overs cricket matches that are interrupted by weather conditions. The Duckworth Lewis Stern (DLS) method is used to calculate the target score based on the number of runs scored and wickets lost by the team batting first, as well as the number of overs available to the team batting second.

To use the Duckworth Lewis Target Calculator:

1. Visit the [Cricket Calculator](https://bhaskaracharjee.github.io/NRR-Calculator/) web application.
2. Switch to the "Duckworth Lewis Target Calculator" tab.
3. Enter the runs scored by Team A.
4. Enter the number of wickets lost by Team A.
5. Enter the number of extra overs available for Team B.
6. Enter the number of wickets lost by Team B.

The Duckworth Lewis Target Calculator will provide the calculated target score for Team B based on the inputs provided.
