# NRR Calculator

NRR Calculator is a web application that allows you to calculate Net Run Rate (NRR) for cricket teams. NRR is a statistical measure used in cricket to determine the average number of runs that a team scores per over compared to the average number of runs scored against them per over.

## Usage

To calculate NRR, follow these steps:

1. Enter the total runs scored by the team.
2. Enter the total overs faced by the team.
3. Enter the total runs conceded by the team.
4. Enter the total overs bowled by the team.
5. Click the "Calculate NRR" button to get the Net Run Rate.

The NRR Calculator will provide the calculated NRR value based on the inputs provided.
